You
And me
Go together like carrots and peas
We should be a happy family
Or a traveling travesty at least

And love
Will fuck us up
Love will fuck us up

Breathe
In deep
Breathe as deeply as you can breathe
Breathe deep 'til you're drunk with glee
Breathe deep 'til you're drunk with glee

And love
Will fuck us up
Love will fuck us up
