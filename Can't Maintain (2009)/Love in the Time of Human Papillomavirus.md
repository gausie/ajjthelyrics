You will cough up crows that peck my eyes  
And I will do nothing but go blind

But my heart  
It has eyes  
And my love  
It has sight  
Even though it may be  
A little cloudy

And you will break my back for all the burdens I lay upon it  
But I will never blame you for those bees inside this bonnet

And my lungs will grow cancers  
And my back it will grow achy  
I will buy us an acre  
Of some land in the city  
We could live there together  
Or I'll live alone less happy  
But I'll live  
Unfortunately
