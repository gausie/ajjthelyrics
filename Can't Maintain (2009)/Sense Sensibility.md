Earnesty and clarity
Those wonderful mentalities
Of decent positivity
Are all that we can strive
But misery and poverty
They follow me, my family
And though it seems that I can't win
I think I have to try
And everyone's afraid of me
They'll never see that we all bleed
The same damn blood each night

So you'll go your way
And I'll go mine
I hope we meet up later on down the line

And sense and sensibility
And peaceful productivity
A pretty girl with broken wings
Is all that I desire
But there's so much hostility 
In all the things surrounding me
The awful glow of enmity
Is trying to stop my shine
So I try to look inwardly
At all the things inside of me
But sodomy and buggery
Keep bubbling to the top

So you'll go forward 
And I'll go back
I hope we catch up with each other on this track

And I've been thinking awkwardly 
About the things that are holy
Like Jesus, Joseph, and Mary
And Mary Magdalene
And even theoretically
I don't think I could ever see
The perfect human being, Jesus
Live without sin

So you'll go upward
And I'll go down
You'll go upward
And I'll go down
You'll go upward
And I'll go down
I'll see you in hell when we die
