Don't know if I believe in God but sometimes I pray  
'Cause the way I was raised keeps me afraid  
A scientist who has to have his way  
I subsist on a steady diet of shame

I hope I can forgive me  
For having the nerve to exist

I hope someone can help me  
Make some sense of this

I work a 10 hour grave  
From 9:00 to 7:00  
I can't fall asleep  
Until 11 past 11:00  
There's no drug that I can take  
That will keep me from being awake  
Past my, past my  
Bedtime

Truckers are the blood in the veins in the body of America  
States are the arms and the legs and the brains and the eyes  
There's a disease, spreading from organ to organ  
And you are the white blood cell that fixes the problem

You don't know your own power  
You don't know what you're worth  
You don't recognize your valor  
And until you do, nothing you do will matter
