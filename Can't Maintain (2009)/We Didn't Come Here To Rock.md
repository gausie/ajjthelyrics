We didn't come here to rock  
We only came to disappoint you  
'Cause deep down in your cunt  
That's exactly what you wanted us to do

You wanted us to lead you on  
You wanted us to bum you out  
So you could build us up  
And you could knock us down

If that's what gets your dick hard  
Telling people they're bad at making art

You wanted to feel cheated  
I guess we gave you what you needed  
So, you're welcome  
Don't worry about it

Just stay on the couch  
Judge what other people do  
Don't do anything for yourself  
I'd hate to see it happen to you

If that's what gets your dick hard  
Telling people they're bad at making art  
Feeling just like you're the one in charge  
Pissing on my most pathetic parts
