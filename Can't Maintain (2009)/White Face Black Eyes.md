They had a white face
They had black eyes
They had burns all over their bodies
They had love for my revulsion
And they kissed away my repulsion
They had a white face
And black eyes

Their father came
From across the sea
To rescue
To rescue
To rescue me

He said
"If you spend all your heart
On something that has died
You are not alive
and that can't be a life"

Love what you can
Love what you can
Until it dies
And let it lie
Let it fly away

Love what you can
Love what you can
Until it dies
And let it lie
Let it fly
Away

He had a white face
He had black eyes
He had burns all over his body
And he was right
