Who are you?  
And where did you go?  
And where are you from?  
And what do you know?

You're in my blood  
And you're in the hair  
You're in my heart  
And you're in the air

I met you, once  
Over the phone  
You sounded sad  
And you seemed alone  
You left me, but  
I never left you  
I never had the chance

Music was the one thing  
We would have had in common  
You were my age when I was born  
Would I have done what you did?  
Would I do what you have done?  
I'd like to think I'm a bigger man than that

You had some problems with alcohol  
You took 12 steps  
And you solved them all  
It took 16 years  
For you to call  
What gave you the brave  
to pick up that call?

You played the trumpet and the drums  
While my Mom sang at funerals  
I play guitar 'till my hands are numb  
You two are where music comes from for me

So thank you so much  
For not raising me  
You spent your life on better things  
You would have been an awful Dad  
But thank you for those genes you had
