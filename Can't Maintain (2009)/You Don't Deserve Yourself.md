I will take your teeth
But I'll hold out for a while
If you please

I'll make you fall asleep
Even if you're not tired

You don't deserve yourself

And I will make you bleed
From your mouth and your nose
And your eyes

Your blood will taste so sweet

You don't deserve yourself
You don't deserve yourself

And I have seen
The darkest heart of humanity

And I truly believe
That we are capable of good as well

You don't deserve yourself
You don't deserve yourself
You don't deserve yourself

And you need to love yourself
You need to love yourself
You need to love yourself
