Well my great grand-dad he died of cancer  
From smoking too many cigarettes  
But I must confess that he did quite profess  
To being the coolest motherfucker I ever met

That's 'cause smoking makes you cool  
And smoking makes you rule  
So just light up a smoke and you'll never go broke  
And you'll be the most popular kid in school  
The coolest kid in school

Well I've traveled millions of Marlboro miles  
But I haven't gotten anywhere  
And I've made a million dollars in Camel cash  
But I'm still just as broke as when I started

But that's OK because smoking makes you cool  
And smoking makes you rule  
So just light up a smoke and you'll never go broke  
And you'll be the most popular kid in school  
But only if you smoke Parliament
