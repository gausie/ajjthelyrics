I'm a lady killer
And you're a pretty lady
And that means I'm gonna kill you
'Cause you're a pretty lady
And I'm a lady killer
And that's just what lady killers do

You find me quite charming
And I find it quite alarming
'Cause I'm gonna take your life
You find me quite charming
And I find it quite alarming
And I'm sad you won't be my wife
'Cause I'm gonna cut you with a knife

Lady killing is a curse
I just killed a nurse
Yesterday with a big gun
Lady killing is a curse
I just killed a nurse
Yeah, lady killing's no fun
But I'm going to do it until I die

I'm a lady killer
And you're a pretty lady
And that means I'm gonna kill you
'Cause you're a pretty lady
And I'm a lady killer
And that's just what lady killers do

It's lady killing season tonight
So let's all go kill a lady
'Cause it's lady killing season tonight!
