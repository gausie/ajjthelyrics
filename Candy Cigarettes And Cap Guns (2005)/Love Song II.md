What makes you think you can be so pretty?
And what makes you think you can be so great?
And what makes you think you can be so intelligent?
And what makes you think you can be so far away?

It's no stretch to say that I am pulling out my hair
And darling I'm patiently waiting to fly my ass out there
And I love you

What makes you think you can be so wonderful?
And what makes you think you can be so keen?
And what makes me think I can be so hurtful?
And what makes me think I can be so mean?

Girl you know I'm sorry I haven't been the best support
But darling you know that I love you
And I would build a fort to protect you
From the wind

What makes you think you can be so terrific?
And what makes you think you can be be so neat?
And what makes you think you can be so beau-ti-fic?
And what makes you think you can be so sweet?

It's no stretch to say that I am pulling out my hair
And darling I'm patiently waiting to fly my ass out there
And I love you
