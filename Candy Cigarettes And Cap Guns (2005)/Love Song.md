I like telling dirty jokes  
And I like smoking crystal meth  
But darling I love you  
And I like laughing at retards  
And I like throwing rocks at dogs  
But darling I love you

I love you like the moon and stars  
When little kids get hit by cars  
Girl you know its true  
Darling, I love you

I've been tryin' to move on  
Since you left, since you've been gone  
But it's so hard on me  
Talked to a girl in first hour  
Bought her a CD, bought her a flower  
But she's a stupid cunt

But I'll take anything  
And I'll take anyone  
I'll take an angry lesbian with a loaded gun  
I'll take a whore with syphilis, and gonorrhea too  
But darling, I love you
