Sometimes I feel like a cigarette
I'm wrapped in paper
And I'm suffocating to death
Suffocating to death
Suffocating to death
Suffocating to death

My heads on fire
My heads on fire
And someone's sucking out of
My nicotine away
My nicotine away
My nicotine away
My nicotine away

I'm the most aborted father
In 18 counties

18 Nationwide I guess
Nationwide I guess
Nationwide I guess
Nationwide I guess

I don't want to be a cigarette anymore
I'll go to hell in my self death
All day and night, so please just put me out
All day and night, so please just put me out
All day and night, so please just put me out
All day and night, day and night
