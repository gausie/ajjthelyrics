I could go off the deep end  
I can kill all my best friends  
I can follow those stylish trends  
God knows I can make amends

But I've got an angry heart  
Filled with cancer and poppy tarts  
If this is how you folks make art, it's fucking depressing

And it's sad to know that we are not alone  
And it's sad to know there's no honest way out

I'm afraid to leave the house  
I'm as timid as a mouse  
I'm afraid if I go on I'll outwear my welcome

I'm not a courageous man  
I don't have any big, lasting plans  
Too cowardly to take a stand, I want to keep my nose clean

And it's sad to know that we are not alone in this  
and it's said to know there's no honest way out

In this life we lead, we can conquer every thing  
If we could just get the brave to get out of bed in the morning
