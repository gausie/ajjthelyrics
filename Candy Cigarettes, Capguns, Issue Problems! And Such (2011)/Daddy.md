Well, once when I was eight
Everything was going great
Until my father, he tried to kill me
By the time that I was nine
My daddy was doing time
And my mother had enlisted in the army
I wish my father had loved me more

By the time was that I was ten
My dad's life was going to end
'Cause he was going on ninety
By the time I was eleven
My daddy was up in heaven in the clouds
Staring down at me

And I can't help but miss him
Even though he hit me everyday
And he tried to hang me with a belt once
And he took nude photographs of my body

And by the time that I was twelve, I had made my first million
And by the time that I was fourteen, I had found the cure to cancer
And by the time that I was fourteen, I was the president of the country
And by the time that I was fifteen, I was the champion of the world

So I'm glad my daddy didn't love me
And I'm glad that he tried to kill me
And I'm glad he took those pictures of me
I am glad my daddy didn't love me
I said I'm glad my daddy didn't love me
