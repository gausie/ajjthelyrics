I like telling dirty jokes.  
And I like smoking crystal meth,  
But darling I love you.

And I like laughing at retards.  
I like throwing rocks at dogs.  
Yeah darling I love you.

I love you like the moon and stars,  
When little kids get hit by cars,  
Girl you know it's true.  
Darling I love you.

I've been trying to move on  
Since you left, since you've been gone.  
But it's so hard on me.

Talked to a girl in first hour.  
Bought her a CD, bought her a flower  
But she's a stupid cunt.

But I'll take anything,  
And I'll take anyone.  
I'll take an angry lesbian,  
With a loaded gun.  
I'll take a whore with syphilis,  
And gonorrhea too,  
But darling I love you.

Darling I love you.  
Darling I love you.  
Darling I love you.
