God made dirt and dirt don't hurt
God made pants and God made shirts
God made dirt and dirt don't hurt
God made our lives so much worse
So much fucking worse

God made guns and God made knives
He ruined all these God-made lives
God made knives and God made guns
God is having so much fun with us
So much fun with us

Heaven is a special place in hell
Where you can watch the people you hate get hurt.

Well God made crack and God made booze
God made the human race to lose
God made crack and God made booze
God made the human race to lose

God made dirt, but dirt don't hurt
God made dirt, but dirt don't hurt
God made dirt, but dirt don't hurt
God made dirt, but dirt don't hurt
