I wanna drive my broke car  
I'm gonna ride my bizike  
I'm gonna walk my big feet  
I'd like to think things through

I wanna have a big heart  
I don't wanna play a small part  
I know I had a rough start  
I'd like to think things through

I think you think I lost it  
I think they think I lost it  
I think I may have lost it  
That just may be true  
But I think they've lost it too

I'm gonna love my children  
I'm gonna love my children  
I'm gonna love my children  
In the hopes that they will too  
I'd like to think things through
