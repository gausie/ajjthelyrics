When I was a little boy  
I fed my mother a bottle of whiskey  
While she was pregnant,  
Unbeknownst to me.

I felt bad to say the least.  
And when my little brother was born  
He had  
What they call  
"Fetal alcohol syndrome"  
The kids used to laugh and taunt him as we'd walk to school.

Its about this time that I discovered a drug  
Called crack-cocaine  
And by the second grade, I had my classmates hooked.  
And in the fourth grade I threw a big crack party,  everyone was invited

And I got a girl named cynthia to blow my little brother for a fix.

And no one would fuck with us

After that.
