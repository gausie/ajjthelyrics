We're all buying into something we say we don't want a part of  
And we're all trying to put our fingers on emotions we can't place  
And we're all dying from those things we put into our bodies  
And we're all lying to ourselves when we say it's all coming together

So let's burn down those bridges and grow into our britches  
Rip out painful stitches  
And make beauty for the sake of sanity

And let's mark our territories and get good at telling stories  
About our long-strived glories that aren't true  
But sure as hell resemble the truth  
And hold the same connotations as two

Let's wash the taste of blood out of our teeth
