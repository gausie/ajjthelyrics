People are wasteful, they waste all the food  
People are hateful, and people are rude  
But God I love some people sometimes  
Because people are very very special

And people are impatient, they don't know how to wait  
And people are selfish, and people are prone to hate  
But God I love some people sometimes  
Because people are the greatest thing to happen  
I said God I love some people sometimes  
Because people are the greatest thing to happen

And People are people, regardless of skin  
And people are people, regardless of creed  
People are people regardless of gender  
People are people regardless of anything  
I said people are people regardless of gender  
People are people regardless of anything

And people are my religion, because I believe in them  
People are my enemies and people are my friends  
I have faith in my fellow man  
And I only hope that he has faith in me  
I said I have faith in my fellow man  
And I only hope that he has faith in me
