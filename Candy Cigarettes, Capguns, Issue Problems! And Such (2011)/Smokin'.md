Well my great grand-dad he died of cancer,
from smoking too many cigarettes.
But I must confess that he did quite profess
to being the coolest motherfucker I ever met.

That's 'cause smoking makes you cool,
and smoking makes you rule.
So just light up a smoke and you'll never go broke
and you'll be the most popular kid in school.
The coolest kid in school.

Well I've traveled millions of Marlboro miles,
but I haven't gotten anywhere.
And I've made a million dollars in Camel cash,
but I'm still just broke as when I started.

But that's okay because smoking makes you cool,
and smoking makes you rule.
So just light up a smoke and you'll never go broke
and you'll be the most popular kid in school-
but only if you smoke Parliament
