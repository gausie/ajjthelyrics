I broke my promise on a very sharp rock
And i was possessed by something quite unfriendly
And i was haunted by a demon in my sleep
And that's how i learned how to survive.
I gave a berr to a bum that was drinking
And i gave some sause to my bestest friends for cooking
And i gave water to all i thought were thirsty
And that's how i learned how to survive.
I gave some money to my bank for safe keeping
And i gave some money to my land lord, he was needing it
And i gave attention to the TV that was bleeding
And that's how i learned how to survive.
And "i don't care if monday's blue,
Tuesday's grey and wednesday's too.
Thursday i don't care about you.
It's friday i'm in love."
We just ripped off a song by the cure
But it's not the first band that we ripped off for sure.
I fed false information to the audience
And that's how i learned how to survive.
I give a thank you to my father for leaving me
And i give a finger to my stepfather for beating me
And i give props to myself for achieving.
Gosh dang i'm glad that i survived.
I just handed you a giant load of gibberish
And i give love to a lover quite deserving of it
And i give thanks to all of you for listening to the story
Of how we all learned how to survive
