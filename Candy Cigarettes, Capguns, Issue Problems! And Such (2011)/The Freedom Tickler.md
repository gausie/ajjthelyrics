You are shit and you know it
Your life is garbage and you show it
You will die soon in the ball pit
I'll leave you unsupervised for a minute
You make drugs look like candy
And you are not even worth it
When you were born I tried to prevent it
With heroin and meth and even weapons
And when you came out I said goddammit
You make drugs look like candy
