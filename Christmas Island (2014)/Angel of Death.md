I am a blank page in a notebook
Waiting to be filled with countless drawings of cocks
I am a bathroom wall, freshly painted over
To cover up swastikas and the names of the girls that we called sluts

I am the Total Gym
I am the Salad Glove
I am the Slap Chop
I'm the forever lazy
I am a boring and worthless thing, and nobody should save me

I am the Kool-Aid stains on the mouth of a kid
Whose name is most likely Cody
He had a juice box for breakfast and he carries a stick that he most likely found in the alley
And Cody doesn't have friends
And his parents hate each other
And he wants to find a better way to love his family
And after school he hangs out in the abandoned house behind the Arby's

I am the camera that watches you
When you think you are awake
And I am a Jesus fish on a drug traffic fan
That keeps all their cocaine safe
I am the guy that eats at least 50 chicken wings
At an all you can eat buffet
I'm the Xbox controller for a drone operator today

And I'm a hologram of a tanning booth
In a history class from the future
I'm the nuclear test, called Operation Dominic
That gave my grandfather cancer

And I am a video store clerk and an angel of death
"Hello how are you? My Name is Trevor."
Prepare to die
Bad Lieutenant 2 is the greatest movie ever
