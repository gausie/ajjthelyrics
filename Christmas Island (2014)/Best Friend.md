Everything makes me bleed
The sparkle won't shine if you don't feed it light
Balls deep in reality
I spend all my time getting strung out on life

It's not our world anymore
It's not our world anymore

Your dead best friend is walking up the stairs
He's walking up the stairs with you

What is the wind saying?
Does it tell who isn't there?
Do the spirits haunt us
by blowing through our hair?

It's not our world anymore
It's not our world anymore

Your dead best friend is walking up the stairs
He's walking up the stairs with you

It's not our world
And it never was
And that's not our problem
That's not our problem anymore
