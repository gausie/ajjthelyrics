In came the being-born police  
To take the newly undeceased  
I was the softened gaze upon a child of God

And the sky was full of teeth  
Anticipating that sweet release  
I was the little engine that could  
I was a courtroom bomb-sniffing dog

And the blood collector collected blood  
And the cannibals all sang  
Tra-lala-lala-lala-la-lang

They found a weird calling card  
In a puddle of body parts  
Inside a bowl of angel hearts  
That the children were eating

I was a vampire hunter  
I was a pregnant mother  
I was the tears shed for the ones that die believing

And the blood collector collected blood  
And the cannibals all sang  
Tra-lala-lala-lala-la-lang

Thunderdome, broken home  
Everybody dies alone  
I wanna give a shout-out to the innocent bystanding

And out the corner of my eye  
Coming out from the teeth-filled sky  
With eyes as red as a dog's asshole when you see it shitting

I saw the Children of God  
As they walked on slovenly by  
The USB ports in their arms were bleeding

And the blood collector collected blood  
And the cannibals all sang  
I think I can, I think I can  
I think I can, I think I can  
Tra-lala-lala-lala-la-lang
