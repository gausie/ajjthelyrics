Shoot him again 'cause I can see his soul dancing  
Shoot him again 'cause I can see his soul dancing  
I'm gonna miss this place

If you give it to me I'll give it back much harder  
If you treat me like a son, then I'll treat you like a daughter  
Everyone has a future, everyone has a soul  
Everyone has a heart, they have a mind, they have control. (Oh-oh)

The Coffin Dancer dances like he has something the prove because he does  
He sleeps a couple hours in the morning, hates the morning when he wakes up

The Coffin Dancer dances like he wants to make a friend, but he does not  
The eye contact he makes with each and everyone he doesn't see is kinda hot  
I don't wanna go to here, there's nothing left to go on here  
There's nothing left to go on, but the love and sense of tender in your eyes

Shoot him again 'cause I can see his soul dancing  
I'm gonna miss this place  
I'm gonna miss its face  
Just like a vein inside my heart
