What do you have hiding in that sarcophagus?  
What do you see? Every pattern looks like a swastika.

What kind of mercy exists in deathlessness?  
And how do we breathe in our breathlessness?

What do I bring to the table when all we eat is desperate?  
Can you erase it with a magnet?

There was a chainsaw fight. I saw it at the water park.  
And though the sun is up, it's still getting dark.

How can I live, never knowing the beauty of forgiveness?
