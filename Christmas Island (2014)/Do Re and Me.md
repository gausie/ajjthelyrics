I walked into a room full of corpses  
The room all smelled like flowers  
There were Nikes on their feet  
Hail and smile under the cloth

I gazed into the souls of all the horses  
Who jumped off all the bridges in those wild western days  
A spaceship made of death

Do  
Re  
Mi Fa So La Ti  
Do, Re, and Me

I gave into the needs of all my masters  
Man is the Bastard is a brutal fucking band  
And they hate Thomas Lens

I fell into a coffin full of orphans  
They all had been slaughtered by a website-making man  
With music in his heart

Do  
Re  
Mi Fa So La Ti  
Do, Re, and Me

Do  
Re  
Mi Fa So La Ti  
Do, Re, and Me

Do  
Re  
Mi Fa So La Ti  
Do, Re, and Me
