Getting naked and playing with guns  
There's a gerbil in the microwave, a baseball bat in everyone  
Sharing kisses and building a bomb  
We'll set it off like Microsoft in '94  
We'll set it off like Microsoft in '94

McDonald's PlayPlace before the Xbox  
Cake frosting, sweet talking, bedroom wall  
Covered in knives, touching God, burning shit  
We'll make a wish and take a trip to Future Town like our daddy did

And we'll kill the neighbor kid who only wants to be our friend  
His dad is dead enough that his new dad his new dad can cure the bends  
We'll make a wish and take a trip to Future Town

Feeling weird, yet tasting sweet  
It's a top-bottom, rock-smoking magic mask making it bleed  
Feeling sweet, getting weird  
Now I can see the playground through the trees  
And I can see the playground from the trees

And we'll show the neighbor kid what our love actually means  
He's here from out of town and I heard he's got A.D.D.  
We'll climb the tallest branch with a rifle full of dreams  
And we'll blow the little dickhead up to smithereens

Getting naked and playing with guns  
There's a gerbil in the microwave, a baseball bat in everyone  
Sharing kisses and building a bomb  
We'll set it off like Microsoft in '94  
We'll set it off like Microsoft in '94  
We'll set it off like Microsoft in '94 in our backyard
