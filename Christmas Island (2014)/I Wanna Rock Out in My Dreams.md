I wanna rock out in my dreams
Instead of waking up I wanna sleep
Wearing black leather pants
With boots too tall to see me
I wanna rock out in my dreams

Since I got back from the place you live
I haven't been the same, I just eat and drink a lot
I should probably say that I miss you
And I could even rhyme that with kiss you
But these days that just seems too goddamn cheap

I wanna rock out in my dreams
Instead of waking up, I wanna sleep
Sweet dick denim jacket shredding a flying-V
I wanna rock out in my dreams

The older I get, the better I am at lying
The more friends and family I have dead or dying
It's harder to define love
I've gotta drink more if I wanna catch a buzz
The older I get, the more articulate I am at whining

I wanna rock out in my dreams
I wanna rock out in my dreams
I wanna rock out in my dreams
I wanna rock out in my dreams
