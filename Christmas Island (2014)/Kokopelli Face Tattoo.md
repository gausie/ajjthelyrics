I was a sexy little viper ruin  
In the corner of a King Tut tomb  
When the hate train started  
Going "Choo-choo."

I was a rat on a burning ship  
When we sunk, our fire got put out  
It was just like the great plague  
It's like the birth of underwear

Hey dude I hate everything you do  
But I'm trying really hard to not hate you  
Hating you won't make you suck any less

I was a wheel in a war machine  
Now I'm a toilet in a restaurant  
Somebody's gotta do it  
I know my place

I was a baby killing Cadillac  
Now I'm a drug induced heart attack  
Somebody's gotta do it  
I know my place

Hey dude, I hate everything you do  
But I'm trying really hard to not hate you  
Hating you won't make you suck any less

Have you ever wanted to be  
Have you ever wanted wanted to see  
Someone better, in the mirror

Have you ever wanted to go  
Have you ever wanted to know  
Somewhere greener, somewhere cleaner

I bet you got something beautiful in mind

They're gonna beat me till I'm black and blue  
Give me a Kokopelli face tattoo  
And I'll tell you a secret  
Kreuz is German for "Williams"

In the blood cult of the misled youth  
I've got a bad case of the yellow flashlight blues  
Let me tell you some weird shit  
There's gonna be a big ole Civil War inside my house tonight

Hey dude, I hate everything you do  
But I'm trying really hard to not hate you 'cause  
Hating you won't make you suck any less

And hating you won't make me suck any less  
Hating you won't make you suck any less
