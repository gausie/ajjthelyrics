Today I lost my shit in a museum
It was a video installation of Linda Ronstadt
And I really miss my friends, but I don't see them
All I see is this video of Linda Ronstadt

Today the salt and sun ran down my face
After a year of hiding all my feelings
And I totally lost my shit in that museum
All from a video installation of Linda Ronstadt

I almost made it through a year of choking down my fears
But they're gone for now
All thanks to Linda Ronstadt

I almost made it through a year of choking down my fears
But they're gone for now
All thanks to Linda Ronstadt

I can't handle astounding works of beauty
I think I like my pretty pretty ugly
But the beautiful soul I witnessed in that movie
Was an entirely different kind of overwhelming

It was a dog that won't stop barking
Like a cut that never stops bleeding
Arizona sunsets in the early evening
Or a grown man inconsolably weeping

I almost made it through a year of choking down my fears
But they're gone for now
All thanks to Linda Ronstadt

I almost made it through a year of choking down my fears
But they're gone for now
All thanks to Linda Ronstadt

I almost made it through a year of choking down my fears
But they're gone for now
All thanks to Linda Ronstadt
