Like a god begging to be murdered  
A revolving door that only goes one way  
A simple force speaking through a conduit  
A baby born on an ordinary day

A Jesus that doesn't want to be a Jesus  
Is given no other choice than to be a Jesus  
Understanding life is meaningfully worthless  
The world was born to kill all the Jesuses

There's something big and powerful and wise  
And it's begging us to end its worthless life  
So let's be Temple Grandin for the night  
And find a friendly way to make it die

On an empty street in a neighborhood that used to be better  
In an empty house once filled with heavy shit  
In a nearly empty bed inside a nearly empty room  
I learned it

There's something big and powerful and wise  
And it's begging us to end its tragic life  
So let's be Temple Grandin for the night  
A hug without a human is all right

We'll find a friendly way to make it die  
A hug without a human is all right  
We'll find a friendly way to make it die
