Open up your murder eyes and see the ugly world that spat you out  
Open up your ugly mouth and sing the words it taught you, spit them out

In the days before the damage no one knew if we were happy  
In the days before the damage dying wasn't nearly easy now  
So open up your murder eyes and see the ugly world that spat you out

Stevie Wonder to the bullshit  
Stevie Wonder to the bullshit, baby  
Write a nice pop song about it

Cut the world in half I bet that you will go and find a sleeping giant  
Turn the page just to wake him up and then turn the page and then turn the page to kill him

In the days before the damage boredom was the same as waiting  
In the days before the damage water was the only raining  
In the days before the damage human beings were the ones that did the chasing

Open up your murder eyes; see the ugly world that spat you out

Hellen Keller to the bullshit  
Hellen Keller to the bullshit  
Break through your isolation

Temple Grandin to the bullshit  
Temple Grandin to the bullshit baby

Find a nicer way to kill it  
Find a nicer way to kill it

Find a nicer way to kill it  
Find a nicer way to kill it  
Find a nicer way to kill it

Find a nicer way to kill it  
Find a nicer way to kill it  
Find a nicer way to kill it  
Find a nicer way to kill it
