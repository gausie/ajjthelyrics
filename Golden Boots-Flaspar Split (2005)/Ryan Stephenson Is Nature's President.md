I'll fight a fight that I can't win.  
I'll commit the mortal sin.  
Then God will punch me in the chin.  
And then I'll smile a toothless grin.  
I'll smile a fucking toothless grin.

We were born to fuck shit up.  
We drink our juice from broken cups.  
And we hurt those that mean most to us.  
And then we crumble, fade to dust.  
Then we crumble, fade to dust!
