We are buying into something we say we don't want a part of  
And we're all trying to put our fingers on emotions we can't place  
And we're all dying from those things we put into our bodies  
And we're all lying to ourselves when we say it's all coming together

So let's burn down those bridges and grow into our britches  
And rip out painful stitches  
And make beauty for the sake of sanity

And let's mark our territories and get good at telling stories  
About our long-strived glories that aren't true  
But sure as hell resemble the truth

And let's go to the art walk and bring our box cutters  
And we'll cut those mother fuckers that wear the wrong gang colors  
We'll go to The Loft at Fifth Roosevelt  
And set it up like the carter projects  
And show those fuckers hell  
And we must wash the taste of cum out of our teeth
