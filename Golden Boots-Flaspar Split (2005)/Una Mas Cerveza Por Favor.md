Drink another beer my darling  
You're drinking for 2  
When skylar got out of prison i was worryin about you  
He can be a mean motherfucker  
You know it's true  
He got out of prison with parole and a swastika tattoo  
Now i am worried for you  
And the well being of your baby too

So the baby's gonna have a daddy  
Well that's wonderful news  
He won't be the greatest parent  
But neither will you  
Gotta get out while you can  
Otherwise you're screwed  
Your legs are broken and your eyes are black & blue  
Now i am worried for you  
And the well being of your family too
