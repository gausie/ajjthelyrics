The first month after you left
I drank and jerked off 'til I slept
I went to work when I had to
And then came home

I fed the dog when I had to
I fed myself when I had to
Went out of town when I had to
And then came home

And I know this won't last forever
But goddammit it feels like forever
Since we've been together
'Til we'll be together again

The second month after you left
I still felt real depressed
But I've got plenty of other things
To spend my time on

I hate whiny fucking songs like this
But I can't afford a therapist
Sorry guys
Here's a solo

And it's harder to be yourself
Than it is to be anybody else
I wish I was someone closer to you

And I know this won't last forever
But goddammit it feels like forever
Since we've been together
'Til we'll be together again

Woo!
