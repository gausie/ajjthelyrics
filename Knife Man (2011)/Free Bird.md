There's a tongue in my mouth  
There's a lock on the door  
And I can't imagine wishing for more  
I've paid for my crimes  
And I've unlied my lies  
And now I'm adorned with a clever disguise

I'm free as a bird  
I'm free from my words

There is a pill  
I've been meaning to swallow  
And it's shaped like a record  
That I'd love to borrow  
And covered in shit  
I've been meaning to wallow in  
I don't know where I'll be tomorrow

I'm free as a bird  
I'm free from my words  
I'm free as a bird flying over the sea  
Just can't find the summer

If there's a god in the sky  
Or a devil below  
That doesn't matter to me  
'Cause I see Satan's face when I look in the mirror  
I see God inside all of the people I meet

I am free as a bird  
I'm free from my words  
I'm free as man whose out wandering the streets  
Looking for shelter
