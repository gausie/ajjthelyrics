I'm gonna fuck the devil in his mouth
I just need to listen to my sickness so I can learn how
And then train for a couple of weeks
Until I have all the skills I need

The flask is an alcoholic's paintbrush
The flask is an alcoholic's toothbrush
I need to go throw up now
I wanna be the queen of all the belly rubs now

I'm gonna quit my job
'Cause I've got another job
And I don't need to work two jobs
I guess you could call me lucky

I need to confront my own weakness
Some days I feel like I'm the weakest
And others the strongest, these days are the longest
And I've got the weirdest feeling about this

I wanna go away for a while
Away for a while
Because the things that I have seen
Are turning me into a shitty human being
