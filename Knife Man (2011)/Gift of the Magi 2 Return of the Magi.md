I used to be a dead guy  
Now I'm a fucking Jedi  
And I've got lots of news for you  
And I've got a long list of things to do

I used to dwell in the present  
I used to be so hesitant  
But now I've got my whole life to live  
And I've got all my love to give

To all you fuckers that I hate

It's like the Gift of the Magi  
It's like the Gift of the Magi 2  
You sold your soul to buy some tits  
And I sold my soul to grow a dick

We gotta get him in the van  
Well what if he resists?  
Just kick him in the back of the fucking head  
And put him in the back of the fucking van

It's a miracle of science  
All this betrayal and violence  
And it lives inside us all  
It lives inside our hearts  
Just like a stupid fucking tapeworm

Who can we blame?

The husband divorced his wife  
After she cut her hair  
Because she was way less fuckable  
And that's just unforgivable  
He moved into a condo  
He hung out by the pool  
But he never wore a bathing suit  
He just wanted to scope out the talent

If God doesn't like ugly  
Then God doesn't like anybody  
So fuck God anyway  
God is obsolete

My God thinks my jokes are funny

There's no one to blame  
People are just fucking mean

Go Suns!
