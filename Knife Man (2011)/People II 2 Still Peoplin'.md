If you've been kicked in or abused
Or mistreated or misused
You were been told there's nowhere to go but up for you
If you've be hurt or you've been betrayed
Or you've fucked or you've been displaced
You were told it was probably your fault anyway

So when you Hustler subscription
And you Xanax prescription
Make you feel lonelier instead
You don't want to hear about all those starving children
You don't want to be told it's all in your head
'Cause if it's all in your head
That's terrible

I saw a junkie lying in a puddle of his own blood last week
I saw a cyclist get hit by a car
I saw a homeless guy chug a bottle of mouthwash on Christmas eve
No you can never fall too far

You can buy a salad glove
You can buy an iPod
And you can sell that shit to Bookmans when your wife dies and you lose your job
You can can hope it gets better
You can follow your dreams

But hope is for presidents
And dreams are for people who are sleeping

My friend Aaron says at best we're all two or three bad decisions away
From becoming the ones we fear and pity
And Tony says it's important to bear some witness when you can
And that's not hard to do in the city that I live in

You don't have it any better
You don't have it any worse
You're an irreplaceable human soul
With your own understanding of what it means to suffer
And that's a huge bummer
