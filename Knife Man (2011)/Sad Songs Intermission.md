They say ambition is an enemy of greatness  
And greatness is an enemy of fame  
When I pick up my guitar  
And I try to write a song  
I think of what my mentor used to say:

"Who fucking gives a rat's ass, Steve?  
Just write a love song  
'Cause they'll keep your belly full  
And your wallet lined  
Don't bother these nice people  
With your sad sack songs  
If you ask me  
I think they're just a waste of time"

Inspiration is the best friend of my sorrow  
And sorrow is the best friend of my drink  
Well I wanna look myself in the eye tomorrow  
But I'm too worried about what other folks will think

"Who fucking gives a rat's ass, Steve?  
Just write a love song  
See a counselor  
If you need to ease your troubled mind  
And could you please sit over there  
I don't want you crying in my beer  
Do you want some cheese with all that whine?"

There's a song that I keep trying to sing to no one  
But I'm afraid that it's too short or it's too long  
And to add to all the things that I'm afraid of  
The devil stopped sending me his songs

And the troubles in my heart need to get let out  
The troubles in my heart need to escape  
And I never liked writing poetry  
And I never liked doing pottery  
And god knows that I never learned to paint

So every now and then, I'll sing a sad song  
'Cause it keeps my spirit light, my conscience clean  
And if you don't care to hear it  
I don't mind if you go out for some air

'Cause I'm happy that you're happier than me  
I'm happy that you're happier than me  
I'm happy that you're happier than me
