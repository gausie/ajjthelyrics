The skate park is only fifteen minute men songs away  
And there is nothing I would rather do on this terrible fucking day  
Than break break break my my bones  
And feel the pain of self improvement

It's not your job to make everybody happy  
You don't have to answer to anyone or anybody  
Just stick stick stick to your guns  
And don't quit until you feel like changing them

And it's a sin and a shame  
To keep yourself from knowing  
The things that make you beautiful and complete  
And we lie to ourselves  
We can feel our insides rotting  
When the world should be bowing at our feet  
At our feet

Stick stick stick to your guns  
And don't quit until you feel like changing them  
Stick stick stick to your guns  
And don't quit until you feel like changing them  
Stick stick stick to your guns  
And don't quit until you feel like changing them
