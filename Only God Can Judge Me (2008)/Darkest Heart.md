Show me your tears
Show me your scars
Show me your flesh wounds
Show me your heart
Show me your death bed
So that I may rest in peace

Show me your teeth
Show me your claws
Break all my bones
Break all my laws
Show me your darkest heart
So that I may rest in peace

Eat my arms
Eat my legs
Eat the flesh between my ribs
Eat my face
Eat my hair follicles
Eat my brain
So that I may rest in peace
