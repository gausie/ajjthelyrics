Growing up
Really fucking sucks
I've got too much stuff
I don't make enough
And soon
I'm gonna turn to dust
I'm gonna turn to dust
And I am afraid I don't care

Growing up
Really fucking sucks
I've fallen down
And I can't get up
And soon
I'm not going to bother
I'm going to lay on the ground until I die
And I'm afraid I don't care

Growing up
Really fucking sucks
I want to fall in love
But I don't love anybody
And soon
There will be nobody
Who will want to fall in love with me
And I'm afraid I don't care
