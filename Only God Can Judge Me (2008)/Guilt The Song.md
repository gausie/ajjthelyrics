I was drifting
Into dreaming
And I saw something
I hadn't seen before

Two young ladies
I hadn't seen since high school
Holding a piece of me
Inside a plastic jar

And there was a hook attached to it
And they were attached at the hip

I was driving
On vacation
And I saw something
I hadn't seen in years

A man was seizing
On the pavement flailing
And I did nothing
A white dressed woman carried him off

I didn't lift a finger
I didn't stop my car
I just kept on driving
I didn't help that man at all

And I hope he forgives me
