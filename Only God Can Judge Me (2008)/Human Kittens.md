I knew a woman once  
Giving birth to kittens and mice  
And as you know with their eating habits  
Those poor mice had to die

So the kittens were born  
Full of their brothers and sisters  
And they were punished swiftly  
Though they didn't know why

They thought they were food  
They did not know what they'd done

And I was a person once  
Sending off unread letters  
Receiving no reply  
Never bothering asking why  
I had a heart once  
Full of fire and passion  
But the summer took it away from me  
And autumn has come to retrieve it

And I was a man once  
When I was six-years-old  
But now I am just a boy  
Pretentious and brash and bold

The kittens were murdered  
Thrown into burlap sacks  
And weighted down with rocks  
In a river deep and black

And they went to Heaven  
They went to Heaven
