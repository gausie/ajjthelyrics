I am so mad at you  
For making me such a bastard  
For giving me such high standards  
I'm mad at you

But I'll find you inside of someone else  
Even if finding you in of someone else is hard to do

This never ending pursuit of happiness  
Is getting harder and harder to accomplish  
The lies I tell myself just so I can get by  
Are getting less and less convincing all the time

And I just can't shake the feeling that I'll be alone forever  
Please tell me that's not the case

So I will go look for  
Things I find important  
And qualities that are unique  
And traits I find attractive in other people
