There will come a day when our cells won't regenerate
And everyone you know will rot away, rot away
Your friends and enemies and all your family
We will all be buried in the ground, in the ground

Let's make the most of it
'Cause life's too short to fuck with

Once an hour a day I get very sad, yeah
Once an hour a day I get depressed
When that hour is over I start to feel okay
'Cause I am reminded I'll rot away, rot away

I don't have much time
To hang out here and cry
And though that may feel nice
I can't do that everyday

I've had a lot of friends and they've done a lot of drugs
And those drugs made my friends rot away, rot away
They say Jesus saves but Jesus doesn't care
'Cause he is in a grave, in a grave, in a grave.

Let's be our own God
And take care of ourselves and the ones that we love
