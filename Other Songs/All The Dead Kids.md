I can't tell you why your children are dying,  
but I can offer you my sympathy.  
And I can't show you where your children are buried,  
'cause they're not.  
They're not buried anymore.

You can shout it from the roof-tops,  
you'll be preaching to the choir.  
And you better get started on this funeral pyre.

And I wish I could cry tears of blood but I can't,  
my body just isn't built that way.  
And I hope all this suffering amounts to one good fucking thing,  
but it won't, because we can't see that far.

You can shout it from the roof-tops,  
you'll be preaching to the choir.  
And you better get started on this funeral pyre,  
and one day I will truly set myself on fire  
so you can see how dim my light is.  
So you can see how dim is my light
