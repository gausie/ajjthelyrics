"Art" is a dirty word picked apart by dirty birds
and run over by herd of angry buffalo
buffalo

And you are a dirty bird with a mouth full of dirty words
And I wished that you were ripped apart by herd of buffalo
buffalo

And I'm just a buffalo, what else could I possibly know?
Other than "this is a grain of salt; I'll take it with everyone"
And save it for them
