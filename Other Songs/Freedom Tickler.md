You are shit and you know it
Your life is garbage and you show it
You will die soon in the ball pit
I’ll leave you unsupervised for a minute 

You make drugs
You make drugs
You make drugs
Look like candy

And you are not even worth it
When you were born I tried to prevent it
With heroin and meth and even whippets
And when you came out I said ‘goddammit’

You make drugs
You make drugs
You make drugs
Look like candy
