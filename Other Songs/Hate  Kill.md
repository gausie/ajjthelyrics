I like to be liked by people I like
And I love to be loved by people I love
And I hate to be loved by I hate
I love to be hated by people I hate

Hate 
And kill
Hate and kill

Hate 
And kill
Hate and kill

One for the hard drugs in my body
And two for the bad drinks in my tummy
Three for the evil thoughts in my head
Four for all the people that I wish were dead

Hate 
And kill
Hate and kill

Hate 
And kill
Hate and kill

I’m gonna set your son on fire
I’m gonna set your son on fire
And I’m gonna choke him with a wire
I’m gonna set your son on fire

Hate 
And kill
Hate and kill

Hate 
And kill
Hate and kill

Hate 
And kill
Hate and kill
