Oh I hate my brain  
Because the things I think sometimes  
Are so judgemental and lame  
Ive got everything I want except  
My set of expectations  
Wont stay the same  
Then I really really hate my brain  
I hate my brain  
I hate my brain  
I hate my brain

I used to be a spiderman  
I used to be a cowboy from hell  
But not anymore  
Now im just a clam  
And i live inside this shell  
Inside this shell I am  
Oh god damn I hate my brain  
I hate my brain I hate my brain

And theres a guy in a S.A.R.S mask  
Walking down the street screaming  
Fourth time i've seen something like that  
This week  
And I just  can't shake  
I cannot shake that feeling

That one day that man in the mask will be me

I hate my brain  
I hate my brain  
I hate my brain  
Oh damn I hate my brain
