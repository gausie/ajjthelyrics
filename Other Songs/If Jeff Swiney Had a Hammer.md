I want to see a scene unified  
Where everybody knows everyone  
The hole in this broken ship gets repaired  
Here in the valley of the slum  
We won't need to copy, shit-talk or lie  
We could have our own thing goin  
We could have shows every single night  
People would admire what we're doin

These are our ideals  
These are our demands  
Get on the floor & put up your hands  
We'll ball-gag your mouth  
Turn the safety off  
Squeeze the trigger & rock

I wanna see Olympia in flames  
Omaha reduced to dust  
We need to stop fighting, stop hating, and start writing  
We must we must we must

These are our ideals  
These are our demands  
Get on the floor & put up your hands  
We'll ball-gag your mouth  
Turn the safety off  
Squeeze the trigger & rock

These are our ideals  
These are our demands  
Get on the floor & put up your hands  
We'll ball-gag your mouth  
Turn the safety off  
Squeeze the trigger & rock
