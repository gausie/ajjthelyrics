If it's true  
Oh, what they say  
"that good things come to those who wait"  
But who do you exactly explain  
All those poor, dumb bastards in LA?  

They came for stardom  
They came for fame  
Now they got holes inside their brains  
From freebasing cocaine  
All those poor dumb, bastards in LA  

They're ghosts and robots  
Complacent broads  
And all the girls have implants  
And they're all blonde  
There are no sunsets, there are no dawns  
In that sad, sad place they call LA  

Take it away, Nick. Do a whistle solo  
[whistles]  

They came for stardom  
They came for fame  
And they've got holes in their brains  
From freebasing cocaine  
Those poor, dumb bastards in LA  
Those poor, dumb bastards in LA  
In that sad, sucky, shithole they call LA  

[whistles]
