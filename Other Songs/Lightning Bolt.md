The best years of his life is what he gave to you  
never late a day he's been faithful and true  
putting out the tombstones and digging down the graves  
for over thirty years now and i can't believe you have the nerve to say  
that you're gonna have to cut his pay  
because one of your priests did such an awful thing

lightning bolt oh lightning bolt why don't you strike them down  
for what they did they deserve to be a black spot on the ground  
and if there is a god up there in the clouds  
i cant imagine a better time to show his wrath than now  
some how these monsters all seem higher than the law  
they wont see any punishments at all

he didn't give a damn about your god or your church  
he was just an honest man looking for some honest work  
and in his little finger he has more purity  
than a whole church load full of your child molesting priests  
its seem you're making him pay for the guilty sins  
thirty years and thats the thanks he gets

its hard to imagine there can be a greater sin  
than using your trust for abusing a kid  
as hard as it may seem well i think that there isn't  
you're committing it by protecting these old evil men  
and if there really is a judgement day  
you'll have a whole lot to explain

lightning bolt oh lightning bolt why don't you strike them down  
for what they did they deserve to be a black spot on the ground  
and if there is a god waiting up there in the clouds  
i cant imagine a better time to show his wrath than now  
some how these monsters all seem higher than the law  
they wont see any punishment at all
