Hey everything, fuck you  
I hate everything you do to me  
I despise every lie I've come to believe  
And I hate every evil thing that I see  
This juxtaposition of good and bad  
Reminds me of the best and the worst dreams I've had  
I'm either too happy or fucking sad  
And I can't keep up with that  
And my job what a shame  
Just a mountain of death filling up my brain  
I am always tied to the tracks of the train  
Desperately afraid of going insane (like my family)

And I'd like to take advantage of a flock of wild birds  
To make to make my escape from this planet  
To make to make my escape from this planet

Christ almighty I am thirsty  
I'm forever fat and ugly  
Stumbling bumbling bastard stubbly  
Faces will always be hungry  
And I don't know if I am capable of helping anyone  
I am at the mercy of emotions of my better friends
