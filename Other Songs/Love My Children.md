I will drive my broke car
I'm gonna ride my biz-ike
I'm gonna walk my big feet
And i'd like to think things through

And i wanna have a big heart
I don't wanna play a small part
I know i had a rough start
But i'd like to think things through

And i think you think i lost it
And i think they think i lost it
And i think i may have lost it
Well that just may be true
But i think they've lost it too

And i'm gonna love my children
I'm gonna love my children
I'm gonna love my children
In the hopes that they will too

I'd like to think things through
In the hopes that they will too
I'd like to think things through
