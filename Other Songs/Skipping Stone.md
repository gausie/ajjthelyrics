I'll be your lake if you are my skipping stone.
I will be your company if you find yourself alone.
I will be your money if you can't afford a home.
I'll be your lake if you are my skipping stone.

I will be your jacket if you're stuck out in the cold.
And I'll be your medication when you're sick and tired and old.
And I'll be your umbrella if that roof just won't hold.
I'll be your jacket if you're stuck out in the cold.

But of course I know that you need some time to grow.

I'll be the ground that you've been walking on.
And I will be your coffee made at the break of dawn.
And I will be the rook and the bishop and the pawn.
I'll be the ground that you've been walking on.

But of course I know that you need some time to grow.

I'll be your lake if you are my skipping stone.
I will be your company if you find yourself alone.
I will be your money if you can't afford a home.
I'll be your lake if you are my skipping stone 
I'll be your lake if you are my skipping stone
