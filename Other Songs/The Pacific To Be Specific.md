We're all buying into something we say we don't want a part of  
We're all trying to put our fingers on emotions we can't place  
We're all dying from those things we put into our bodies  
We're all lying to ourselves when we say it's all coming together

So let's burn down those bridges & grow into our britches  
And rip out painful stitches and make beauty for the sake of sanity

And lets mark our territories  
And get good at telling stories about our long-strived glories  
That aren't true but sure as hell resemble the truth  
And hope the same connotations (something)  
And lets wash the taste of blood out of our teeth
