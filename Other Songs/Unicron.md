And I'd like to build a giant machine  
That crushes the mountains and burns all the trees  
And pees in the desert and dries up the seas  
And melts all the ice caps and makes nature bleed  
Cause I want nature to suffer  
And I want nature to cry  
And I want nature to spit in my mouth  
And I want nature to die  
And I want to be a big ball of meat  
That bees can buzz around and eat  
And feast on my liver and rot out my teeth  
And chew on my eyeballs until I'm deceased  
Cause I deserve displeasure  
And I really want to cry  
And I think you should spit in my face  
Because I am a werewolf
