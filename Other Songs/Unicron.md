And i'd like to build a giant machine
that crushes the mountains and burns all the trees
and pees in the desert and dies up the seas
and melts all the ice caps and makes nature bleed
cause i want nature to suffer
and i want nature to cry
and i want nature to spit in my mouth
and i want nature to die
and i want to be a big ball of meat
that bees can buzz around and eat
and feast on my liver and rot out my teeth
and chew on my eyeballs until i'm deceased
cause i deserve displeasure
and i really want to cry
and i think you should spit in my face
because i am a werewolf
