For four fortnights
I have fled from my fortress
Foraging forests five footsteps in length
Fortitude found within 40oz bottles
Flowing like flies from your face
From your face!

My neighborhood is been filled brim with black cats
And when I go driving they walk in my path
All the time
Every time

First we are babies
We're birthing and dying
And then we are children 
We're playing and crying
And then we're teenagers 
And smoking and fucking
But now we're all grown-up
And we're sadly sighing
And liking malarking
And licking our wounds
We've created by lusting
And lying, to ourselves
And to others

We're sadly sighing
We're sadly sighing
We're sadly sighing
We're sadly sighing

And I'd like to be, a big ball of meat
That bees can buzz all around and eat, when I die
So that I might be granted
One sense of purpose
