Do you remember me?  
I killed your family  
And now I am going to kill you too

I made your brother bleed  
I made your father scream  
And I made your mother say those things that she said to me

She said, "Do with me what you want, but please don't hurt my family, don't hurt my family  
Take my pride, take my life, take my body but don't take the ones that are close to me  
Oh, do with me what you want, but please don't hurt my family, don't hurt my family  
Take my pride, take my life, take my body but don't take the ones that I love"  
And I continued without mercy

So I looked into your eyes  
And I saw a reflection  
Of a coward that you and I both hate very much

And then I grabbed the knife  
And I let the blood out of your throat  
And I smashed those tiny mirrors inside of your skull  
And I got to thinking

If I don't go to hell when I die I might go to heaven  
If I don't go to hell when I die I might go to heaven  
If I don't go to hell when I die I might go to heaven  
If I don't go to hell when I die I might go to heaven  
Might go to heaven, but probably not
