Woah, woah, woah...

I have often wondered if a pregnant woman is decapitated, will the baby survive, will the baby survive?
Oh, and I have also wondered if that baby lives his life, what kind of life will the baby lead, and will the baby ever be happy?
No, his heart will be bloated and swollen, just like his soul
Too big to fit in his body

And I don't think that I can take it
And I don't think that you can take it
And I know he sure as hell can't take it

So we all go
So we all go
So we all go

Woah, woah, woah...
