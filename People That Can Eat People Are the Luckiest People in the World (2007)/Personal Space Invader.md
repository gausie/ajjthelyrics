I gave birth to twin wire hangovers
And now I am a personal space invader
I've got essays, I've got finals due
I have got lots and lots of problems
Look out!

And how can you put that straw up your nose
When you know how coke is manufactured?
It's made by children for the immature
It is made by babies who've been captured
It's a sin against your fellow man

And welcome to this world
Have as much fun as you would like
While helping others have as much fun as you're having
Be kind to those you love
And be kind to those you don't
But for God's sake you gotta be kind
And respectful because we're all one soul
Be the best fucking human that you can be!
