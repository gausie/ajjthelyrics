Rejoice, rejoice, God's ears are stitches
Oh, rejoice, his eyes are big X's
Oh, rejoice, his arms are burning witches
Oh, rejoice, his hands perform hexes

Rejoice despite the fact this world will hurt you
And rejoice despite the fact this world will kill you
And rejoice despite the fact this world will tear you to shreds
Rejoice because you're trying your best

And rejoice, the bed you sleep in is burning
Oh, rejoice, the sky's fucking falling
Oh, rejoice, the world we know is turning
Oh, rejoice, your father's been calling

Rejoice although this world will devastate you 
And rejoice although this world will penetrate you
And rejoice although you will not survive
Rejoice you'll never make it out alive

And rejoice, your hair it smells like burning hair
Oh, rejoice, your nails all got chewed off
Oh, rejoice, and holy fuck you're bleeding there
Oh, rejoice, you burned your whole beard off

Rejoice despite the fact this world will hurt you
And rejoice despite the fact this world will kill you
And rejoice despite the fact this world will tear you to shreds
Rejoice because you're trying your best
