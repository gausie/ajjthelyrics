I broke my promise on a very sharp rock  
And I was possessed by something quite unfriendly  
And I was haunted by a demon in my sleep  
That's how I learned how to survive

And I gave a beer to a bum that was drinking  
And I gave some sauce to my bestest friend for cooking  
And I gave water to all I thought were thirsty  
That's how I learned how to survive

And I gave my money to the bank for safe keeping  
And I gave my money to my landlord, he was needing it  
And I gave attention to the TV that was bleeding  
That's how I learned how to survive

If you ain't got the do re mi, boys  
If you ain't got the do re mi  
Well you better go back to beautiful Texas  
Oklahoma, Kansas, Georgia, Tennessee  
California is a Garden of Eden  
A paradise to live in or see  
But believe it or not  
You won't find it so hot  
If you ain't got the do re mi

And we totally ripped off a man named Woodie Guthrie  
And I bought a restaurant for his son named Alice  
And I fed false information to the audience  
That's how I learned how to survive

And I give a "thank you" to my father for not raising me  
And I give a finger to my step father for beating me  
And I give props to myself for achieving  
God damn, I'm glad that I survived  
God damn, I am surprised I have survived

And I just handed you a giant load of gibberish  
And I give love to a lover quite deserving of it  
And I give thanks to all of you for listening  
To the story of how we learned how to survive
