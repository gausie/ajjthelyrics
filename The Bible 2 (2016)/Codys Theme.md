When I was a kid  
My whole reality split  
I was living a lie  
I was a killing machine  
I was a war lord  
When I closed my eyes

I had to talk to the teacher  
She talked to my mom  
We had a real long talk  
I had to talk to the teacher  
She talked to my mom  
They made the visions stop

When I was a kid  
I was a total dick  
To inanimate objects  
The world beat the hell from me  
I took it out on a tree  
Great Illustrated Classics

I took it out on a fig tree  
Out on the lawn  
I took it out on the backyard  
And behind Rite Aid  
I took it out on the crates  
And on the shopping carts

Meanwhile on another plane  
I was the king of pain  
An unspeakable cruelty  
I set the mommy on fire  
I set the baby on fire  
Not even Jesus could stop me  

I had to talk to the teacher  
She talked to my mom  
We had a real long talk  
I had to talk to the teacher  
She talked to my mom  
They made the visions stop

I had to talk to the teacher  
She talked to my mom  
We had a real long talk  
I had to talk to the teacher  
She talked to my mom  
They made the visions stop

Stop, stop, stop
