You had what you had
Until the horses took it
You knew what you were
And you couldn't stand it
You loved your country
Enough to support it

But nothing ever made you complete
No, nothing ever made you complete
Golden Eagle

You respected the sport
And you could afford it
A hundred hobbies
You have outlived
Your mother, she called bullshit
And you ignored it

But nothing ever made you complete
No, nothing ever made you complete
Golden Eagle

You had what you had
Until the horses took it
But on a second glance
No no no no you did it
You killed a man
And you wrote a book on birds, but still
