Last week I saw you at the junkie church  
You told me all the things I need to hear
Like I've got a heart of gold
And a kind and open soul
So we went and bought ourselves a can of beer
Steel Reserve

I was manic at the clinic
I was feeling like my body disappeared
My tongue rolling around
In the void inside my mouth
It was infinite and brown and kind of weird
Infinite

And the waiting room was pissing in my ear
The waiting room was pissing in my ear
So we went and bought ourselves a can of beer
Steel Reserve

Oh, I love you cause I love you cause I can
I love you cause I love you cause I can

Last time I tried to go to sleep
My head expanded in an air balloon of words
A thousand conversations
With your disembodied voice
In a cacophony of adjectives and verbs
Air Balloon

On your last night at Saint Mary's
You were way too intoxicated to breathe
So I used your ribs as ladders
And I climbed up on your chest
And I jumped up and down just like a trampoline
Trampoline

And the ambulance was mean as it could be
It melted both my tennies to the street
That night, I stole a candy bar from Circle K
Milky Way

Oh, I love you cause I love you cause I can
I love you cause I love you cause I can

Oh, I love you cause I love you cause I can
I love you cause I love you cause I can

Oh, I love you cause I love you cause I can
I love you cause I love you cause I can
