My brain is a human body
My brain is a human body
And you will not get out
You will not get out
My blood is worse than your blood
This heart pumps baby piss
So you will not get out
You will not get out

I thought I saw you before I knew you
I thought I saw you before I knew you
I thought I saw you before I knew who you were

My body is a bezoar
Big ball, blood, teeth, and hair
I give just like I take
I eat whats on my plate
My body is a bolus
Floating in my lover's stomach
I won't evaporate
It's better for my brain

I thought I saw you at the Quiznos
I thought I saw you at the Peacock park
I thought I saw you before I knew who you were
