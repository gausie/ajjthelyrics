When I'm a dead boy  
Burn my body  
Pour a couple of my ashes into concrete  
Build a bench, 10 feet long, 12 inches tall  
Leave it somewhere, central Phoenix  
Where no security guards will dare try to protect it

Layer of wax on the corner, near a QuikTrip  
With smooth ground so the stepkids can do their kickflips

An ugly wave in a sea of ugly flatness  
A beautiful wave in a sea of pretty flatness  
A mania wave in a sea of simple sadness  
Until they tear me down

When I'm A Dead Boy  
When I'm A Dead Boy
