I saw white worms crawling out of my face
I saw white worms crawling out my nose
I watched white worms falling out of the skin
I saw white worms

And if you don't want to feel the feeling, no one should ever make you feel the feeling
If you don't want to feel the feeling

I saw white worms I saw white worms I saw white worms

My teeth are brown my lips are blue the grass is green my tongue is too
I rode that horse that horse was you
I saw white worms

And if you don't want to feel the feeling, no one should ever make you feel the feeling

Some dumb dick says don't stop believing you can stop believing (stop believing)
Just stop believing (stop believing)
You can stop believing, stop believing
Don't don't stop believing

And if you want to hear the devil's music you should probably listen to the devils music

I saw white worms I saw white worms
I saw white worms I saw white worms
I saw white worms I saw white worms
I saw white worms I saw white worms

If you want to listen to the devil's music you should probably listen to the devil's music
If you want to listen to the devil's music you should probably listen to the devil's music
